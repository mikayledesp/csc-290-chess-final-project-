# CSC 290 Final Project - Lucy Kreipke and Mikayle Despaigne
## Abstract
 For our final project, we decided to add more depth and tactical play to our minimax chess bot by choosing the option of giving the bot knowledge of standard chess openings. In our proposal, we planned to use a database of chess games to focus on openings. We believed that less random opening moves would lead to more interesting and complex games. While coding, we decided to implement a fixed first move. We then used a CSV file containing various chess FEN strings to guide the bot’s move selection before calling the minimax algorithm. This approach is still in line with our original proposal to make the games more interesting. Instead of making subsequent opening moves completely random, we compare the bot’s response to the current board’s FEN state so it can make a more informed decision.
